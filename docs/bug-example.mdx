**Bug Report Example**

**Title:** Console error "Invalid hex color: transparent" occurs during application load/use when add task page is opened.

**Severity:** Low (No apparent user-facing functional impact, but indicates a code health issue)

3. Click on "Add Task" button to navigate to the task creation page

    ```
* Despite the error, the application appears to function correctly for the user, including color selection and display.

**Analysis/Notes:**
* The error suggests a function expecting a hexadecimal color string is receiving the CSS keyword "transparent" instead.
* This specifically occurs when accessing the Add Task page and interacting with the color selection component.
* The error occurs within minified production code (`index-fPFPlENQ.js`), making direct debugging difficult without source maps.
* While functionally benign from an end-user perspective currently, it indicates a minor flaw in the color handling logic and should ideally be fixed for code robustness and cleaner console output.
